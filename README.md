# KIT307-Graphics-and-Animation
KIT307 2018 place to store files for graphics engine (they might be added to the original graphics engine github next year)
Angle helpers:    AVAILABLE (My work building off of the original author of the file)
Colour Library:   NOT YET AVAILABLE (I still claim ownership for the idea)

TO USE THESE FILES IN YOUR ASSIGNMENT, to cover the copyright and plagarism issues 
attribute the helper functions to Connor Chamberlain


Angle functions are provided via a modified Transform.cpp file. These functions allow the user to
modify the rotation of an object by using an amount in degrees.
NEW FUNCTIONS: 

	void turnLeft(float degrees);
	void turnRight(float degrees);
  
	void lookUp(float degrees);
	void lookDown(float degrees);
  
	void rollLeft(float degrees);
	void rollRight(float degrees);
  
	void setRotationInDegrees(float x, float y, float z);
  
	void turnX(float degrees);
	void turnY(float degrees);
	void turnZ(float degrees);
